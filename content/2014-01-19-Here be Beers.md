Soon, there will be beer. The intention of this  website is to create a resource for in depth reviews about beer recipes. Specifically, I'll be posting about beers that I've actually brewed! My hope is to brew on a weekly or biweekyl basis, mostly in small roughly 3-4 liter batches using the plethora of recipes available on sites like [Beer Smith](http://beersmith.com/beer-recipes/), [beerrecipes.org](http://beerrecipes.org/), and the plethora of other beer recipe sites.

I hope everyone enjoys the reviews and finds this webpage useful in deciding what you'll brew next.
