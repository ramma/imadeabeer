First brew is in. Specifically a lemon-lime wheat beer as inspired by [this recipe](http://beersmithrecipes.com/viewrecipe/127579/lemon-lime-hefeweizen). I modified the recipe a bit by using a lemon-lime juice mix with the highest juice percentage I could find. I also left out the zest and the majority of the hops.

Since my goal here is the test lots of beers in low quantities I also scaled the recipe down to a total of about 4 litres. Since it turned out great, I'm assuming my math was close enough!
